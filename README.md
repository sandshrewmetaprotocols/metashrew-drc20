# metashrew-drc20

BRC20 implementation for the dogecoin DRC20 structure.

Forked from [https://github.com/sandshrewmetaprotocols/metashrew-shibes](https://github.com/sandshrewmetaprotocols/metashrew-shibes) with imports from [https://github.com/sandshrewmetaprotocols/metashrew-brc20](https://github.com/sandshrewmetaprotocols/metashrew-brc20) to properly handle variable block rewards, as it is done in the dogelabs ordinals implementation.
